Customers:

-Companies that hold data and want to make use of them

-Academics

-Companies that want to include data analysis in their services


Examples of customer needs and our role:

-A company that offers IT infrastructure, such as EDI, holds a lot of data. Mining them might provide valuable insights and new products-services for them to offer. We can build a prototype for them

-A company that has already found the use for their available data is looking for a person to join their team. They are looking for a long time and haven’t found the right person. We step in for a limited amount of time and start working until they have found the what they are looking for.

-A company knows that they will need someone for a certain period of time but they are not sure if they want to use overtime, or hire someone. We offer them a middle solution via a fixed time contract.

-A professor in the life or social sciences is thinking about a cool project he is not sure whether it will work out but he also can’t wait for too long until the idea is obsolete. We step in and do an initial “feasibility analysis”.
That said professor moves on with the project and everything goes fine until one of his grad students drops out. We step in and bring the project to the finish line.

-An engineering company would like to add more functionality to their products – e.g. self diagnostics for mechanical constructions. We combine our expertise with theirs. 

-A data science company has a customer in Greece-Cyprus and need support. We are data scientists we speak the language and we have experience of the Greek market. What else could they ask for?


Places and ways we can find our prospective customers:

-Networking with friends and colleagues

-Freelancing internet sites of high quality such as TopTal

-Direct contact with companies that look for personnel.


On competition:

Given the products that we wish to sell, one can infer who the competitors are.

-IT consultancy firms: They are the more traditional players in the market. At the same time, most probably, we do not directly compete with them. They offer more traditional IT consultancy services and they address their products to bigger firms than the ones we are interested. For examples see Ernst and Young, ICAP.

-Smaller more recent firms that focus on Data Science: they are newer in the market and usually are smaller, led by younger people. They are closer to the start-up mentality with respect processes, hierarchies, etc. It seems that are structured around the concept of ‘Data Product’. They have built something that they then sell as a service.

-Freelancers: here things are more diverse. In different sites there are people from various countries, with different education levels, etc.

-Individuals: I have included them because in certain cases a firm or a professor has to choose between contracting us and hiring an employee – researcher.

--What I would like to point out is that our main goal with respect competition is to ‘move around’ it. We cannot compete with EY but we can provide a more specific service. We don’t offer a specific ‘data product’ that we try to sell to everyone, but we try to offer custom solutions to their problems. There will always be people with better CV’s than ours, but a team almost always beats any individual.
