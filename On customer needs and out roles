Companies that want to include data analysis in their services

Examples of customer need and our role.
A company that offers IT infrastructure, such as EDI, holds a lot of data. Mining them might provide valuable insights and new products-services for them to offer. We can build a prototype for them
A company that has already found the use for their available data is looking for a person to join their team. They are looking for a long time and haven’t found the right person. We step in for a limited amount of time and start working until they have found the what they are looking for.
A company knows that they will need someone for a certain period of time but they are not sure if they want to use overtime, or hire someone. We offer them a middle solution via a fixed time contract.
A professor in the life or social sciences is thinking about a cool project he is not sure whether it will work out but he also can’t wait for too long until the idea is obsolete. We step in and do an initial “feasibility analysis”.
That said professor moves on with the project and everything goes fine until one of his grad students drops out. We step in and bring the project to the finish line.
An engineering company would like to add more functionality to their products – e.g. self diagnostics for mechanical constructions. We combine our expertise with theirs. 
A data science company has a customer in Greece-Cyprus and need support. We are data scientists we speak the language and we have experience of the Greek market. What else could they ask for?
